# DiceGame
To learn Javascript, I made a Dice game that you can play by refreshing the page. I thought this challenge for my course was going to be a bit harder, but the hardest part was choosing different colors for the website! I really enjoyed this challenge though. It was a nice test of my skills and a break from studying if only for a little while.
